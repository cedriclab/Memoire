# Memoire

This is a project I worked on as a part of my Master's thesis to complete my graduate Economics program at the Université de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, QC, Canada) under the supervision of Dorothée Boccanfuso and Kim Lehrer.  It is basically a quiz structured as thus:
- Warmup questions
- Game questions, where users have access to various external resources
- Personal questions

If you want to re-use it for your own purposes, feel free to.
It comes "as is" and without any kind of warranty.

This uses the following libraries and styling packages:
- jQuery
- Underscore.js
- Backbone.js
- Materialize.css
- FontAwesome

Server-side, it is a NodeJS/Express app, relying on a MongoDB datastore.
Given that the package.json file is already there, you can simply use "npm install" to install the required dependencies.
